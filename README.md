## ðŸ“‚ **Portfolio**  
Check out my **[Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/jthomp33/THOMPSON-Data-Science-Portfolio)** for projects that showcase my skills. This will continue to be updated as I develop a stronger portfolio. Be kindâ€”I'm just getting started!  

Right now, this includes a basic app in stremlit that filters penguins by various metrics like body weight, flipper length, and species. This is my first app, and I am pretty proud of it. You can access it through the link above, and learn about its functionality in the ReadMe file there. I will be adding more projects as my skills grow, but this is my starting point!
